# üöÄ Fix Calendar Weekly and Monthly Views Showing "No Data"

_Fix calendar initialization to display data from correct date periods instead of current date._

## Description

This PR fixes the issue where Weekly and Monthly calendar views show "No Data" despite having timesheet data available.

**Problem:** Calendar views were initializing with the current date (June 2025) while timesheet data was from different periods (May 2025), causing a date mismatch.

**Solution:** Modified calendar components to initialize with the first data date when available, ensuring calendars display the correct period containing the data.

**Impact:** Users can now properly view timesheet data in Weekly and Monthly calendar modes.

## What Was Changed

### Major Changes

- **Fixed WeeklyTimesheetCalendar initialization**: Calendar now starts with the week containing the first data entry
- **Fixed MonthlyTimesheetCalendar initialization**: Calendar now starts with the month containing the first data entry
- **Added data-driven date logic**: Calendars automatically navigate to periods with actual data

### Minor Changes

- **Enhanced useEffect hooks**: Added proper data dependency tracking for calendar updates
- **Improved user experience**: Eliminated manual navigation requirement to find data

## How to Test This PR

1. **Setup:**
   ```bash
   yarn dev:web
   ```
   Navigate to timesheet page at `http://localhost:3030`

2. **Test Weekly Calendar:**
   - Switch frequency to "Weekly"
   - Switch to "CalendarView" mode
   - Verify timesheet data appears (no more "No Data")
   - Check calendar shows correct week containing your data

3. **Test Monthly Calendar:**
   - Switch frequency to "Monthly" 
   - Switch to "CalendarView" mode
   - Verify timesheet data appears (no more "No Data")
   - Check calendar shows correct month containing your data

4. **Verify Daily still works:**
   - Switch frequency to "Daily"
   - Confirm Daily calendar view continues to work as before

5. **Test with different date ranges:**
   - Change date filters to different periods
   - Verify calendars automatically adjust to show the new data periods
