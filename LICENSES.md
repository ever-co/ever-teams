This software is available under an Open Source License ("Community Edition"). It is suitable if your business can comply with the requirements of corresponding open-source licenses, see more information below (e.g. requirements to release your modifications under the same open-source licenses for the benefit of our community).

Alternatively, commercial versions of the Ever Teams software must be used in accordance with the terms and conditions of the separate written license agreement between you and Ever Co. LTD. With a commercial license, your source code (including your changes) is kept proprietary. You can purchase a commercial license at <https://ever.team/pricing>.

In addition, Ever Co. LTD holds copyright and/or sufficient licenses to all components of the Ever Teams Platform, and therefore can grant, at its sole discretion, the ability for companies, individuals, or organizations to create proprietary modules that may be dynamically linked at runtime with the portions of Ever Teams Platform which fall under our copyright/license umbrella.

We support the open-source community. If you're building awesome non-profit/open-source projects, we're happy to help and will provide (subject to [acceptance criteria](https://github.com/ever-co/ever-gauzy/wiki/Free-license-and-hosting-for-Non-profit-and-Open-Source-projects)) Ever Teams Enterprise edition license and free hosting option!

More details are explained in our [Wiki](https://github.com/ever-co/ever-gauzy/wiki/Free-license-and-hosting-for-Non-profit-and-Open-Source-projects).

**The default Ever Teams™ Platform license, without a valid Ever Teams™ Platform Small Business or Ever Teams™ Platform Enterprise License agreement, is the Ever Teams™ Platform Community Edition License.**
